# Women-breast-cancer-prediction
Empowering early breast cancer detection, this project utilizes specific features to predict the likelihood of malignancy. Its cutting-edge approach aims to deliver highly accurate results, fostering timely diagnosis and improved patient outcomes.

The project includes a data cleaning process, addressing null values and duplicates. Since it is a supervised learning problem, encoding with the target variable has been performed. The data has been split into training and testing sets. Both random forest and XGBoost algorithms have been employed to predict Malignant or Benign outcomes. The optimal lambda value has been determined to build the XGBoost model. Evaluation metrics have been utilized to assess and interpret the results.
